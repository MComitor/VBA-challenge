### VBA-challenge ###

Lots of challenges with this exercise! 

<details>
    <summary>Easy Solution</summary>
        <p>Finally got the **easy** solution to run on individual sheets, however, all the numbers do not match the example image.</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Moderate Solution</summary>
        <p>I experienced many issues with my **moderate** solution. While this script did generate a new Combined Sheet, all sheet values failed to carry over. It's as if the script gets hung up on the first ticker line and then doesn't know how to proceed. The debugger highlighted line 62 as a 'Type mismatch' error (stock_vol). This is confusing to me because I've defined the stock_volume as LongLong initally. What's happening here?</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Bonus</summary>
        <p>I ended up abandoning this extra credit portion of the assignment as I couldn't get my moderate solution to work successfully.</p>
